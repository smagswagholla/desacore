## Reposity for game code.

To set up the code for your own computer follow the steps that show you how to set up git on the homepage. Afterwards
you need to create your own local repository (on your computer) to store all of the files. 

I found this really helpful: http://lifehacker.com/5983680/how-the-heck-do-i-use-github
Just don't make a README. That's what this already is. After you set up a GitHub folder you can send a pull request, basically
asking me to let you download the code using the repository.

When everything is in your folder, open eclipse. It will ask you what folder you would like to use so specify the one you just
downloaded. Then you can open and view my code.

This is your own personal local repo now. Anything you change on your code will be changed only for you. After you've finished
editing or adding code, you can submit the changes. To make things easiest, it would be best to create a new branch based off of
what you did. In the link above it shows you how to commit code too, you should be able to commit your code. We will all be able
to see who's editted what, when it was edited, and what's been change.

Remember that your code doesn't automatically change. Whenever you're about to start coding, make sure you check for updates
by pulling info from the repo, it should keep yours up to date.
